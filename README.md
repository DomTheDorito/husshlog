# HuSSHLog
Pronounced "Hush Log", this is a  super basic terminal based ham radio logger built in Python. 

Tried to capture the vibes of DOS loggers, while still making it platform agnostic.

Six included color pallets (Cyan, Amber, Red, Grey, DOS-Amber, and DOS-Green)

Expect some UI tweaking, and additions such as POTA and Field Day templates.
